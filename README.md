# WeChat Mini Program WKU-ER
A mobile faulty equipment reporting system called WKU Easy Request is designed to create an online system integrating repair reporting and management. In this project, I develop a Mini Program on WeChat which makes the users no longer need to install an application or register an account before use. Two modules are provided in the program varied with priorities: requester mode and manager mode. In the requester mode, users are allowed to request repair services and send feedbacks; in manager mode, users are allowed to edit repair persons, manage repairs and view feedbacks.
